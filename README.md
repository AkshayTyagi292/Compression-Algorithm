# Compression-Algorithm(DataSqueeze)
This project is based on Huffman Compression Algorithm in Python

Platform: Python | Duration: 6 Months
Developed a file compression and decompression system using Huffman Coding in Python named as DataSqueeze. Implemented efficient encoding and decoding by building a binary tree, generating Huffman codes, and handling file input/output. Demonstrated proficiency in algorithms, data structures, and Python programming.
